# config-rs-maint

> Layered configuration system for Rust applications (with strong support for [12-factor] applications).


## Note

This is a maintenance fork of [config-rs](https://github.com/mehcode/config-rs/)
because the upstream maintainer(s) are unresponsive.

I will maintain this fork as I see fit, but contributions are welcome.
Bugfixes and new features are explicitely welcome here.

As soon as upstream is responsive again, I hope I can work with them to include
all patches landed here into upstream.
